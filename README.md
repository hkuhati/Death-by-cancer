# Death-by-cancer

Cancer.csv is the data set used here to ananlysize the rate of cancer affecting millions of americans in the current world. The analysis on this dataset is done by three types of cancer i.e breast cancer, lung cancer and colorectal cancer. The project focuses on female death caused by these cancers.
The project is in R programming language. Analization of these data patterns will help us to predict the type of cancer that will more prevelent and race type which is more prone to the illness causing the death rate of a women. 

The total female death rate will be the outcome in this project. The goal is to find out the future rate by using the present data. 

### Overview

- The project first goes through the different aspects of the data set such as death rate, population of the US, etc. Secondly the rate of cancer in male and female.  The response variable is choosen as the total female death rate. 
 
- The correlations explains the effects of total female death rate on the total rate of the country and the corresponding states also it shows the comparison to the types of cancer.

- The linear models were made to compare the female death rate with the types of cancer. So from the analysis it is concluded that prediction on total female death rate due to lung cancer has the highest accuracy.

- Multiple regression was performed for all the models with lung cancer by using different race factors and the analysis concluded that prediction on total female death rate due to lung cancer and being from a black race has the highest accuracy. 

The prediction can be summarized that lung cancer has been one of the highest cause of death rate in female in the US, particularly the female belonging to black race.
